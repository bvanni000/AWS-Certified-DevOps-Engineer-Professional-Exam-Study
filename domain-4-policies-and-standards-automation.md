# Domain 4: Policies and Standards Automation
## Apply concepts required to enforce standards for logging, metrics, monitoring, testing, and security
* Detect, report, and respond to governance and security violations
* Apply logging standards across application, operating system, and infrastructure
* Apply context specific application health and performance monitoring
* Outline standards for delivery models for logs and metrics (e.g., JSON, XML, Data Normalization)

## Determine how to optimize cost through automation
* Prioritize automation effort to reduce labor costs
* Implement right sizing of workload based on metrics
* Assess ways to improve time to market through automating process orchestration and repeatable tasks
* Diagnose outliers to determine use case fit
  * Example: Configuration drift
* Measure and automate cost optimization through events
  * Example: Trusted Advisor

## Apply concepts required to implement governance strategies
* Generalize governance standards across CI/CD pipeline
* Outline and measure the real-time status of compliance with governance strategies
* Report on compliance with governance strategies
* Deploy governance policies related to self-service capabilities
  * Example: Service Catalog, CFN Nag
